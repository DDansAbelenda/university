# Cuda Trapezoid Method
This is a project where the NVIDIA programming model, CUDA, is used to calculate the integral of a function using the trapezoid method. 
The calculation is carried out both in parallel and sequentially and the speedup of the program is determined from the execution times of both. 
The scripts used are to run the program on an sm_37 architecture.
